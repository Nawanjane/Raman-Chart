Users can upload `.asc` files, and the application will display a chart comparing the Raman shifts and intensities from the uploaded files.

## Features
- Upload and analyze `.asc` files containing Raman spectroscopy data.
- View and compare multiple Raman shift charts on a single graph.
- Interactive chart with zoom and pan capabilities.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Nawanjane/Raman-Chart.git

```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It is a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
